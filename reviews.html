Ron was friendly and very knowledgeable on the phone. He even tried to ask me about trying a few things so I could fix it quickly myself if it was an option. We just bought the house and I had limited tools with me so he said he would be over as soon as he could. I told him I would be leaving soon for a few days and may not be there. He even declined when I told him I could leave money on the counter for him if I wasn't there. He said I could pay him if and when he had to fix anything. Lo and behold he was there before I could even get out the door. After a quick diagnosis he believed he would have to run back to the shop to get a new pump. He told me it would probably run a bit over a grand. That's a good chunk of change but extremely fair and seeing as I had no options I was ready to pay for the new well pump and install. I had to leave before he came back and he told me he could leave an invoice on the counter or email it to me. To my delight he called and said when he pulled the pump there was a voltage mismatch between the pump and the house. He made a quick adjustment and called me with the good news. Better yet, the cost was DRASTICALLY lower than what I expected, barely more than what I expected to pay for the service call. I was ready to pay the full amount for the pump install and I wouldn't have known any different. Ron's honesty was greatly appreciated. In the future I won't call anyone else to service my well. Thanks again Ron!

One had our front yard and the whole ditch filled with water from a big leak! Dan and his crew came out right away for both issues. They were so kind and informative, eager to put us at ease and gave a range of options to solve the problem rather than convincing us to do one. Really great service and family owned business. I saved their number in my phone immediately. Highly recommend!

You can expect them to work with you to determine exactly what you do need and don't need. They are thorough in their estimates with no surprises at the end like many companies do these days. They are also great at getting back with you. I couldn't believe how many companies wouldn't even return my phone call, that's not the case here! I would highly recommend Thompson Well Drilling!

The other company recommended a new well which would have cost 5K. I had just bought the house a couple of weeks earlier and was on the verge of losing it. I called Thompson's for a seconded opinion. Dan showed up a couple of hours later and spent over an hour going through my system and explaining what was going on. Long story short, he recommended running my hoses for 4-5 hours to flush everything out and it worked! He literally saved me thousands of dollars and was professional and compassionate about my issue. I highly recommend contacting them about any well issues.</a></p>
